# javajofer

Jofer backend rebuilt with Java.
Jofer was a final project which assisted employers and 
HR departments to autmate the hiring process.

This project is intended for learning purposes to display an ability to translate
a project between languages and learn a language quickly.

Because the Node environment has advanced greatly, there is really no advantage 
in using Java/JVM over node, even at scale for the project.

## Goals

- Copy Jofer's current backend moving models into classes.
