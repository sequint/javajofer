# javajofer

Jofer backend rebuilt with Java.
Jofer was a final project which assisted employers and 
HR departments to autmate the hiring process.
Because the ideal client for Jofer is a business at scale, a Java backend build 
is the Jofer teams solution to scaling up the data structures for complexity, 
speed, and security.

## Goals

- Copy Jofer's current backend moving models into classes.
